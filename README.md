🔍 Fallacy Search Web Application: [Fallacy Search](https://fallacy-search.streamlit.app/)  

The Fallacy Search application helps users identify potential logical fallacies in any text. It uses GPT-4o to detect and analyze common reasoning errors and argumentative flaws. The tool aims to promote critical thinking and improve the quality of public discourse by making logical analysis more accessible.

Fallacy Search has been developed and benchmark tested as part of a data science master thesis at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU). For more information, see GitHub repository: [fallacy-detection](https://github.com/aimfeld/fallacy-detection)
